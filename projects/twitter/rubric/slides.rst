Twitter slides grading rubric
=============================

Your group will be responsible for preparing a Pecha Kucha style talk.  The
expectation is that your group will prepare 20 slides for your talk.  You
should divide the slides up evenly among the members of your team.  The night
before your presentation you will need to email your slides as a PDF file to
Johnny.  We will have a laptop connected to the projector with your slides
preloaded.  When it is your group's turn, we will call you to the front of the
room and once everyone is ready we will start playing your slide deck.  Each
slide will auto-advance after 20 seconds.  Thus it is essential that you
carefully prepare and rehearse your presentation.  If you get out of sync with
the slides, it will distract from your presentation and cause confusion and
difficulty for your teammates.  If your team has any non-static slides (e.g.,
animations), you should talk with Jarrod as soon as possible to confirm the file
format can be displayed.

We expect you to present substantial work.
You will need to motivate your questions, explain how you manipulated your
data, and justify any conclusions you make.  This is a technical talk, so focus
on conveying information rather than trying to merely entertain.

Below is the grading rubric we will be using to assess your submissions. To
receive the equivalent of an "A" on this assignment your group will need to
have roughly two check marks and two check pluses.
