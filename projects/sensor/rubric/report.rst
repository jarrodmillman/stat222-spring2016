Statistics 222 grading rubric
=============================

For the sensor project you will need to submit a print out of your written
report in class on Wednesday, March 9th, in addition to the submission on github.

You should include figures and text in the body of your report.  Your text
should be organized into appropriate sections.  Your figures must be labeled,
captioned, and referred to in your text.  Leave all code snippets, including
variable names, out of the main body or the report; however, you will be
expected to include all relevant code in an appendix.  The code is part of your
report and you should spend some time making sure that it is readable, correct,
and clear. While you should not directly refer to the code in the report,
you will need to describe your analysis fully in the text. For example,
while you should not mention what type of looping structure or variable
names you used for a simulation, you must include enough detail such that
someone reading your text should be able to write his or her own program
to reproduce your results.

Below is the grading rubric I will be using to assess your submissions. To
receive the equivalent of an "A" on this assignment you will need to have
roughly two check marks and two check pluses.
