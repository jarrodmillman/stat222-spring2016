Sorry for the delay. The idea of the finance project comes from the following paper:

See here for a blog post discussing the paper:

The attachment is the report for my group project in IEOR 222 (financial
engineering system I). You can go directly to the data/methodolgy section of
the report. Now that I think about it, it might be too simplistic for a
statistics project. To a certain extent, the goal of the project is simply to
introduce various machine learning techniques to people who study finance.
