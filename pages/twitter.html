<p>For this project, your primary data source will be Twitter. And you will
be expected to work with the Twitter API using Python to access this
data. On Monday (2/23), we will briefly review Python, introduce JSON
(Javascript Object Notation), and demonstrate how to interact with the
Twitter API using the <a href="https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter">Python Twitter
Tools</a>. However, you will need to
do outside reading to get up to speed with these tools.</p>
<p>Python Twitter Tools is one of several Python packages<a href="http://www.danielforsyth.me/analyzing-a-nhl-playoff-game-with-twitter">^1</a> for
interacting with the Twitter API. It is fairly minimal and is the
package used in chapter 1 and 9 of <em>Mining the Social Web</em>.<a href="https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition">^2</a></p>

<h1 id="your-assignment">Your Assignment</h1>
<p>Each group is responsible for creating a presentation that visually
answers a set of questions, which you will determine for yourselves. You
will first need to decide on a set of question that you can use Twitter
data to answer. Once you determine the questions you wish to address,
you will need to use the Python twitter package to download the data
from Twitter that you will use to answer the question. You are free to
use Python to analyze the data and create plots. Since you’ve had
limited practice with Python, you are welcome to use R for some of the
analysis and for creating your figures. However, even if you decide to
use R for the some of the analysis and plotting, you must use Python to
retrieve the data as well as most of the preprocessing. Using Python
save the data as a CSV file, which you can then read with R.</p>
<p><span><em>Which</em></span> questions you answer is up to you, but think about
telling a story. The story will be more interesting if the questions you
address are related to each other in some way. Here are a few example
topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>investigate the relation of breaking news on Twitter versus
    traditional news sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compare stop words usage on Twitter versus NY Times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chart how the ratio of positive versus negative words used in tweets
    involving some event (or issue) change over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relate tweets about a TV show/movie/book to their viewers/ticket
    sales/sales over time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Your final presentations are due in three weeks. Here is the tentative
schedule of the next several classes:</p>
<p><span>@l|l@</span> &amp;\
(2/23) Start Twitter project &amp; (2/25) Poster presentations for airline
data\
(3/2) Text mining &amp; (3/4) Pecha Kucha\
(3/9) Group work &amp; (3/11) Practice presentations\
(3/16) Final presentations &amp;\</p>
<p>Note that you will have a practice presentation on the Wednesday, March
11th. Your group will need to have already prepared and practiced your
presentations within your group prior to the 11th. We expect a fairly
polished talk for your practice presentation. After your practice
presentation you will receive feedback on how to improve your
presentation. Part of your final grade for this project will involve how
you respond to feedback from your practice presentation in your final
presentation.</p>
<h1 id="initial-guidance-to-do-for-first-data-debrief">Initial Guidance (to do for first data debrief)</h1>
<p>Since this is the first project for which you’ll have to define and
obtain the data yourselves, the goal for the first week is for you <em>to
define what tweets (or other info) you want to work with, download that
data, and wrangle it into a simpler format</em>.</p>
<p>An important goal for this project is to provide an opportunity for you
to get more practice using Python. In particular, for this project we
expect you to gain more experience working with basic Python structures
(lists, dictionaries, tuples, and strings) and work with JSON and CSV
using Python. You will also be using Python’s string processing and text
mining capabilities to process the data.</p>
<p>We will reserve 20 minutes on Wednesday (2/25) for you to meet with your
new group and discuss possible topics/datasets. In preparation for that,
you should each come up with three ideas between Monday and Wednesday.
In addition to the Twitter data, your group should also discuss what
other data sources you may need to use.</p>
<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>
<p>Next Monday (3/2), we will discuss text mining in Python using the
Natural Language Toolkit (nltk).<a href="http://www.nltk.org">^3</a> By this point, your group should
have downloaded the Twitter data and whatever other data you think you
will need.</p>
<h1 id="presentation-details">Presentation Details</h1>
<p>All presentations will be given in the <strong>Pecha Kucha</strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">^4</a> style. A
Pecha Kucha presentation consists of 20 slides that are automatically
advanced 20 seconds (20x20). The complete presentation lasts exactly 6
minutes and 40 seconds.</p>
<p>This is a very constrained format. So you will need to carefully plan
and prepare your talk. Each group will have 4 members and each member
will be responsible for presenting 5 slides. Since the slides will
automatically advance, you will need to practice your talks before you
present in class.</p>
<p>Note that your group will need to have an official in-class practice
presentation on Wednesday (3/11). After your practice presentation, you
will receive feedback, which you should incorporate in your final
presentation on Monday (3/16).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-slides">How to make slides</h2>

save your slides as a PDF. Here are some possibilities for you to
