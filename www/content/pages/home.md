## Statistics MA Capstone Project

In this course you will develop a portfolio of data analysis projects,
culminating in a collaborative group project in which you'll work with an
academic or industry partner. The course is somewhat unique in that it's
organized around data sets and not around a prespecified set of lecture topics.
However, along the way, we'll cover a variety of methods used in modern applied
statistics, we'll explore computational tools for working with non-standard
data formats and doing reproducible research, and we'll practice the
communication skills you'll need to be a successful practicing statistician.
